	abstract = {Measurements have been made of the forces required to peel a thin layer of a model visco-elastic adhesive off a rigid substrate. Over a wide range of temperature and rate of peel the results were found to yield a single master relation in terms of peel rate when reduced to a reference temperature by means of the Williams, Landel \& Ferry rate–temperature equivalence for viscous materials. The relations obtained were complex, however, with two main features: a cohesive–adhesive failure transition at low rates and a sharp decrease in peel strength at high rates. The first effect is shown to be due to a change in the deformation process in the adhesive, from a liquid-like to a rubber-like response. An approximate relation between peel strength and the tensile stress–strain behaviour of the adhesive is developed in terms of a single empirically-determined parameter, the interfacial bond strength. Values of this parameter are deduced for several substrates. Measurements of peeling under hydrostatic pressure showed that cavitation of the adhesive did not occur in these experiments. The second effect is shown to be due to the transition from a rubber-like to a glass-like response of the adhesive. It is also shown to depend on the way in which separation is effected. Some general principles governing the mode of failure and the development of maximum peel strength are outlined.},

The contact between the probe and the adhesive was maintained for 1 s at a nominal pressure of 1 MPa before being detached at a constant velocity. The effect of resin content, probe velocity during debonding and temperature were systematically investigated. Failure was initiated by two main mechanisms: an interfacial cavitation at low debonding rates, giving relatively low adhesion energies, and a bulk cavitation process at higher debonding rates, which gave much higher adhesion energies. In both cases failure occurred at the end by interfacial detachment of fibrils. The characteristic probe velocity where the transition between these two mechanisms took place was controlled primarily by the linear viscoelastic properties of the adhesives. However, the important quantitative parameters obtained from a tack test, i.e., the maximum debonding stress and the adhesion energy, could not be predicted by the linear viscoelastic properties of these adhesives alone.},

Measurements of the viscoelastic properties of the adhesives show that the effect of tackifying resins is to modify the viscoelastic properties so that the adhesive performance in bonding and unbonding is improved. It is suggested that a two-phase system is not necessary for good tack, and a theory based on a two-phase system cannot adequately explain the rate dependence of tack tests. Tack measured by the probe test is shown to be dependent upon a balance between the viscoelastic properties and the transition temperature of the adhesives. This theory is used to explain the effect of contact time, withdrawal speed, and resin softening point on the tack of adhesives.},

	abstract = {A good tackifler resin appears to require a combination of high T9 at low molecular weight, and for this a highly condensed alicyclic structure appears to be desirable. Except for the rosin derivatives, the chemical structures of common tackifier resins are not fully resolved and some more definitive studies are needed. In addition, a high degree of miscibility of resin with rubber is important. Although some common tackifier resins cause phase separation over certain concentration ranges when blended with rubbers, this is probably exceptional, and it seems likely that most adhesive compositions are single phase in this respect. Where phase separation does occur, there is a need for fuller elucidation of the phase morphology and composition of the phases. The widely-held view that a two-phase morphology is necessary for the development of high tack appears to be incorrect. The few studies which have been carried out so far indicate that the surface energy of a rubber is modified only slightly by the incorporation of a tackifier resin. It is unlikely that this surface energy change can seriously affect the tack value as measured by the common form of probe test. The viscoelastic behavior of rubber-resin blends provides an adequate explanation for the phenomenon of tack. Over long response times, the low modulus (high compliance) of the blend compared with that of the rubber alone allows a high degree of intermolecular contact to be achieved during the bonding stage of a tack test. Over short response times, corresponding to the de-bonding stage of the test, the blend shows transition zone response with high energy dissipation and consequent high separation force. For further progress in our understanding, however, there is a need to distinguish clearly between the bonding and debonding effects of the resin and also for a more definitive study of the factors controlling the bonding stage.},

In response to demands for wearable devices, which are curved, bendable and/or stretchable, all components of electronics are required to be flexible. Moreover, the assembly of these components is challenging issue, because the conventional adhesives used in displays are typically rigid unsuitable for flexible electronics. Therefore, developing elastic pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) is critical for the commercialization of flexible electronics. In this study, UV curable acrylate-based PSAs are synthesized using 2-carboxyethyl acrylate (CEA) as a functional monomer, and exhibit exceptionally strong peel adhesion and good flexibility. The synthesized film also exhibits adequate transmittance ({\textgreater}95\%) to be used as an optically clear adhesive. The stress-relaxation and strain-recovery behavior of the PSAs at various conditions is evaluated and analyzed in detail. To induce elastic characteristics in the PSAs, a pre-straining strategy is implemented, which triggers a purely elastic characteristic with instantaneous strain recovery. The pre-strained PSAs were able to withstand 5000 cycles of repetitive stretching and bending tests; thus, the synthesized PSAs can provide wide range of applications, including stretchable displays and epidermal devices.},

The term pressure-sensitive describes adhesives that are aggressively and permanently tacky in the dry form at room temperature and firmly adhere to a variety of dissimilar surfaces upon mere contact, without the need of more than finger or hand pressure. Acrylic self-adhesive polymers are nowadays synthesized from a wide selection of acrylic ester monomers, often with low levels of monomers having pendant functional groups. The three basic types of acrylic common today are solvent-borne, water-borne, and solvent-free acrylic PSAs. They can be used in the production of single- and double-sided self-adhesive tapes, foil labels, carrier-free tapes, self-adhesive bioelectrodes, and decorative PVC signs and marking films. A pressure-sensitive adhesive requires a balance of cohesive strength and viscoelastic properties. These characteristics are based on three parameters: tack, adhesion, and cohesion.},

The pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are one of the important classes following the mechanism of curing of the adhesive which do not undergo any chemical reaction or physical change during the adhesion process. PSAs are greatly replacing many conventional types of adhesive and are considered safe to use.

	abstract = {Soft materials are materials with a low shear modulus relative to their bulk modulus and where elastic restoring forces are mainly of entropic origin. A sparse population of strong bonds connects molecules together and prevents macroscopic flow. In this review we discuss the current state of the art on how these soft materials break and detach from solid surfaces. We focus on how stresses and strains are localized near the fracture plane and how elastic energy can flow from the bulk of the material to the crack tip. Adhesion of pressure-sensitive-adhesives, fracture of gels and rubbers are specifically addressed and the key concepts are pointed out. We define the important length scales in the problem and in particular the elasto-adhesive length Γ/E where Γ is the fracture energy and E is the elastic modulus, and how the ratio between sample size and Γ/E controls the fracture mechanisms. Theoretical concepts bridging solid mechanics and polymer physics are rationalized and illustrated by micromechanical experiments and mechanisms of fracture are described in detail. Open questions and emerging concepts are discussed at the end of the review.},

	abstract = {Self-adhesive materials are called, in the adhesives trade, “pressure-sensitive adhesives” (PSAs). PSAs are designed to stick on almost any surface by simple contact under light pressure. This special class of adhesives does not undergo any physical transformation or chemical reaction during the bonding process. Because of this, the rheological properties of the adhesive must be finely tuned for the application, combining a carefully chosen polymer architecture and monomer composition with the proper addition of small molecules called tackifying resins. PSAs are soft, deformable solids and, depending on the formulation, easily form bridging fibrils between two surfaces upon debonding. They are safe to use and easy to handle and thus are increasingly replacing more conventional types of adhesives. In this article, we review both the primary material characteristics of PSAs and the main physical principles that make them work effectively.},

	abstract = {This issue of MRS Bulletin provides an overview of the state of the art and emerging trends in the area of adhesives. An adhesive is basically defined by its function, which is to assemble two surfaces together. In order to fulfill this function, the properties of an adhesive must include easy positioning at the interface, rapid and complete bond formation and subsequent hardening, and a bond strength adapted to the specific application (structural, permanent, removable, rigid, or soft). A variety of solutions exist in practice, and their application requires an understanding both of polymer chemistry and materials science. The main families of adhesives, their properties, and their basic design principles will be discussed in the articles in this issue, while this introductory article presents an overview of the functions required of adhesives and future trends.},
