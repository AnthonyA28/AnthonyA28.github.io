In out introduction to fracture, we have reviewed the definition of fracture energy $\Gamma$. Recall the definition of the energy release rate: 


$$
G = - \frac{d\Pi}{da} = \frac{d(F \Delta - U) }{da}
$$

Lets use this to determine the fracture energy of peeling a tape.

We condsider peeling at 90 degrees. In this case if we peel the tape some length $\Delta$, the crack will also grow the same length $\Delta$, thus $\Delta = a$.  Note that the strain energy is zero ($U = 0 $) because we assume the tape does not stretch. Our equation for the energy release rate becomes:


$$
G = \frac{d(Fa)}{da}
$$

Thus at crack growth: 


$$
G_c  = F
$$
