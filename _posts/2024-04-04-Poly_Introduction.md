# Polymer Introduction

Polymers are found everywhere in our daily lives, from plastic containers and clothing to medical devices and automotive components. These versatile molecules are made up of repeating units called monomers, which link together to form long chains or networks. The unique properties of polymers, such as flexibility and strength, stem from their molecular structure. By manipulating this structure, scientists can tailor polymers to meet specific requirements.

 Nearly all inorganic, naturally occuring materials are composed of tightly bound regularly aranged atoms, such as crystals, metals, ceramics.
