# Adhesion

Adhesives play a critical role in modern technologies, serving as essential components in applications ranging from optically clear adhesives in flexible electronics [^1]‧[^2]‧[^3]‧[^4] to structural-supporting epoxies in aerospace applications. Despite their widespread use, our molecular-scale understanding of adhesion remains limited, posing challenges to the rational design of advanced adhesive materials [^5]. Among adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) stand out due to their unique ability to form bonds upon light contact without requiring chemical reactions[^6]‧[^7].


## Applications of PSAs

PSAs are used in applications that do not require high loads, can be applied quickly with light pressure, and are removable [^6]‧[^7]. Thus, tapes, labels, and protective films are the primary products utilizing PSAs. Some ubiquitous examples include Scotch tape, Band-aids, and Post-it notes. Moreover, PSAs are critical in electronics, where countless components must be bonded together and may need to be non-destructively debonded [^6]. Recently, PSAs have found applications in advanced technologies such as wearable electronics [^8], flexible electronics [^1]‧[^2]‧[^3]‧[^4], and transdermal drug delivery systems [^9].
