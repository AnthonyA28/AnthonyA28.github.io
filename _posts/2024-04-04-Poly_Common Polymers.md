# Polyethylene 

## Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE)

- **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):** -110°C (-166°F)
- **Crystallinity:** Semi-crystalline (~50-60%)
- **Melting Temperature (Tm):** 105-115°C (221-239°F)
* Common Uses:
  * Plastic bags and films
  * Containers and bottles
  * Coatings for paper and textiles
- **Typical Critical Energy Release Rate (Gc):** 0.5 to 3 kJ/m²
- **Entanglement Molecular Weight**: Approximately 1,300 g/mol


## High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)

- **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):** -120°C (-184°F)
- **Crystallinity:** Semi-crystalline (~70-80%)
- **Melting Temperature (Tm):** 130-137°C (266-279°F)
* Common Uses:
  * Plastic bottles and containers
  * Piping and tubing
  * Plastic lumber and furniture
- **Typical Critical Energy Release Rate (Gc):** 0.6 to 3 kJ/m²
- **Entanglement Molecular Weight**: Approximately 1,600 g/mol


# Polypropylene (PP)

- **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):** -20°C (-4°F)
- **Melting Temperature (Tm):** 130-171°C (266-340°F)
